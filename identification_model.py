# This file (`identification_model.py`) is intended to handle the object identification process.
# However, I have created separate files for object extraction (`object_extraction.py`) 
# and object identification (`object_identification.py`) to keep the code modular and organized.
# The extraction logic is separated to allow easy modifications and testing without affecting 
# the identification process. This approach improves code clarity and maintainability.
