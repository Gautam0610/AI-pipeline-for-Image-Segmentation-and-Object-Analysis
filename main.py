3. **Choose "New repository"**: From the drop-down menu, select "New repository."

4. **Repository details**: Enter a name for your repository, along with an optional description. If you want to make this repository public (visible to everyone) or private (visible only to yourself and team members), choose the appropriate option.

5. **Initial commit**: Optionally, create an initial commit by adding some files or creating a README file.
